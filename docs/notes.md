# Day 01
Hard part in Day 1 was remembering how to parse IO with Julia. Once I had it as a vector, the `.` operator made it easy to apply things elementwise.

# Day 02
Used a brute force approach for the second part. This allowed me to reuse my code from part 1, but probably wasn't optimal.

# Day 03
First regex day! Regex does make this quite boring as it becomes less of a programming logic puzzle and more of a regex tricks puzzle.

For the second part, I used regex to split the string. In hindsight I could have just used regex to capture the middle.

# Day 04
My solution used CatesianCoordinates to search for the correct strings. It isn't a very elegant solution but it works. Becuase of this, I actually found the second part easier.

A fancier solution would have involved flipping / rotating / reflecting the array, but wasn't worth the headaches.
